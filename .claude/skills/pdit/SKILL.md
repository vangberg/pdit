# pdit Collaboration

pdit is an interactive Python editor with inline execution results. The user sees a browser-based
split-pane interface: code editor (left) and streaming execution results (right).

## User's Environment

**Starting pdit:**

pdit runs using `uv run --with` so it's available without modifying the project:

```bash
uv run --with git+https://github.com/vangberg/pdit@dist pdit start script.py --verbose
```

**Note:** The `@dist` branch contains pre-built frontend assets, so no Node.js or build step is needed.

**Upgrading pdit:**

Since pdit is run with `--with`, it will fetch the latest version each time. To force a fresh fetch:

```bash
uv cache clean pdit
```

**IMPORTANT: Run with `run_in_background: true` in the Bash tool so you can continue editing.**

**IMPORTANT: Always use `--verbose` when Claude is running pdit.**

Verbose mode prints all execution output to the console where pdit is running:

- Shows each line being executed (with `>>>` prefix like Python REPL)
- Displays all stdout/stderr output in real-time
- Shows script name with `[script.py]` prefix
- Allows Claude to see what's happening in the user's browser without waiting for feedback
- Essential for debugging and validating code changes

Options:

- `--verbose` - Print all computation stdout/stderr to console (REQUIRED for Claude)
- `--port 9000` - Use different port (default: 8888)
- `--no-browser` - Don't auto-open browser

Server runs on `localhost:8888`, browser opens automatically.

**Exporting to HTML:**

```bash
uv run --with git+https://github.com/vangberg/pdit@dist pdit export script.py
```

This executes the script and generates `script.html` - a self-contained HTML file that can be opened in any browser without a server.

**What the user sees:**

- Left pane: CodeMirror Python editor with syntax highlighting
- Right pane: Execution results grouped by source lines
- Top bar: RUN CURRENT, RUN ALL, SAVE buttons

**User shortcuts:**
| Action | Mac | Windows/Linux |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| Execute selection/current | Cmd+Enter | Ctrl+Enter |
| Execute all | Cmd+Shift+Enter | Ctrl+Shift+Enter |
| Save | Cmd+S | Ctrl+S |

## Code Style

**Write simple, top-level exploratory code** - like a Jupyter notebook, not a production module.

- Prefer flat, sequential statements over functions and classes
- Each line/expression shows its result inline - take advantage of this
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions, loops, or defensive code
- Focus on data exploration: load, inspect, transform, visualize

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df.head()
df.shape
df.describe()
df["price"].mean()
df[df["price"] > 100]
```

## Execution Model

- **Stateful**: Variables persist across executions (like Jupyter kernel)
- **Streaming**: Results appear as each statement completes via SSE
- **Line-grouped**: Results display next to the code that produced them
- **Reset**: User can reset namespace to clear all variables

## Collaboration Workflow

**File watching enabled**: When you edit the Python file, changes appear
in the user's editor automatically.

**Validate before the user sees it:**

- Run the script yourself with `uv run script.py` before presenting to user
- Fix any errors or warnings so output is clean
- User should see working code, not debug your mistakes

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Write/edit the `.py` file
2. Run `uv run script.py` to validate - fix any errors
3. User sees clean code and runs with Cmd+Enter
4. With `--verbose`, you can see execution output in your console and validate without user feedback

**When user shares output:**

- Results show stdout, stderr, and expression values
- Errors include full tracebacks
- Results are associated with specific line ranges

## API (if needed)

```
POST /api/execute-script  - Execute code (SSE streaming)
POST /api/reset           - Reset namespace
GET  /api/read-file       - Read file from disk
POST /api/save-file       - Save file to disk
GET  /api/health          - Health check
```

## Markdown Cells

pdit supports markdown cells for documentation and explanations in top-level docstring

```python
"""
# Data Analysis
This section loads and explores the dataset
"""

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df.head()

"""
## Summary Statistics
Let's look at the distribution of values
"""

df.describe()
```

**Usage:**

- Start with a triple-quoted docstring (`"""..."""`) containing markdown
- Content is rendered as markdown in the output pane
- Supports standard markdown: headers, lists, links, code blocks, etc.
- Great for documenting analysis steps and explaining results

## Matplotlib Plots

pdit captures matplotlib plots automatically:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])
plt.title("My Plot")
plt.gca()  # ✅ This triggers plot capture
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use `plt.gca()` to display plots, NOT `plt.show()`:

- `plt.gca()` returns the Axes object, which pdit captures and renders
- `plt.show()` is for interactive displays and won't work in pdit
- Plots appear inline in the output pane automatically

## Output Suppression

Append `;` to any expression to suppress its output (iPython/Jupyter convention):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5));  # Suppressed - no <Figure> output
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])
plt.title("My Plot");  # Suppressed - no Text object output
plt.gca()  # Shows the plot
```

**Works with:**
- Any expression: `expensive_calc();`
- Trailing comments: `plt.figure(); # setup`
- DataFrames, plots, and regular values

**Does not affect:**
- Markdown cells (explicit documentation)
- `print()` statements (stdout is always captured)

## Output Types & Rich Display

pdit renders different output types with appropriate visualizations:

| Badge | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| >>> | stdout | print() output |
| err | stderr | Error/warning output |
| !!! | error | Exceptions with traceback |
| md | markdown | Rendered markdown from docstrings |
| df | dataframe | Interactive table (pagination, sort, filter) |
| fig | image | Matplotlib figures |
| htm | html | Rich HTML from _repr_html_() |

### DataFrames

Pandas and Polars DataFrames render as interactive TanStack tables:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
df  # Interactive table with pagination, sorting, filtering
```

### Rich HTML Display (`_repr_html_`)

Objects with a `_repr_html_()` method render as rich HTML. Many libraries support this:

**Plotly** - Interactive charts:
```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(df, x="price", y="sales")
fig  # Interactive Plotly chart
```

**Great Tables** - Formatted tables:
```python
from great_tables import GT
GT(df).fmt_currency("price").fmt_percent("margin")
```

**pandas Styler** - Conditional formatting:
```python
df.style.format({"price": "${:.2f}"}).background_gradient(subset=["sales"])
```

### Custom HTML Widgets

Create your own rich displays by implementing `_repr_html_()`:

```python
class MetricCard:
    def __init__(self, title, value, color="#667eea"):
        self.title = title
        self.value = value
        self.color = color

    def _repr_html_(self):
        return f'''
        <div style="background:{self.color}; padding:16px; border-radius:8px; color:white;">
            <div style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">{self.value}</div>
            <div style="opacity:0.8;">{self.title}</div>
        </div>
        '''

MetricCard("Total Revenue", "$1,234,567")  # Renders as styled card
```

This pattern is powerful for building dashboards and custom visualizations.

## Tips

- Expressions show their values inline - `print()` is rarely needed
- Write intermediate expressions to see values: `df.shape` instead of `print(df.shape)`
- Long-running code streams results as each statement completes
- User has full filesystem and package access (local Python execution)
- Use docstring-style markdown cells to document your analysis
- Use `plt.gca()` to display matplotlib plots inline
- Use `;` to suppress unwanted output like `plt.figure()` return values

## Dependencies

Since pdit runs from the local uv environment, add packages with `uv add`:

```bash
uv add pandas matplotlib
```

No server restart needed - packages are available immediately in both pdit and `uv run` validation.
