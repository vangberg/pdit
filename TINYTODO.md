# Tiny todos

A list of tiny todos.

Never work on more than one todo at a time.

If multiple tasks must be carried out to finish a todo, track them as a nested ordered list of the todo list item.

When a todo is done, delete it.

## Todos

* Reader mode: center + set max-width so it does not take up full width.
* Use css grid for output so we can align badges and content.
* Render top-level f-strings as Markdown.
* `"""` should trigger `"""\n[CURSOR]\n"""`
* Disable CodeMirror code folding
* itables: left align everything
* remove debug
