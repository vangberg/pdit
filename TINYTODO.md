# Tiny todos

A list of tiny todos.

Never work on more than one todo at a time.

If multiple tasks must be carried out to finish a todo, track them as a nested ordered list of the todo list item.

When a todo is done, delete it.

## Todos

1. Reader mode: center + set max-width so it does not take up full width.
2. Use icons for Run, Autorun, Reader.
3. Use css grid for output so we can align badges and content.
4. Render top-level f-strings as Markdown.
5. Text-wrap output, even when there's no whitespace.
6. `"""` should trigger `"""\n[CURSOR]\n"""`
