# Tiny todos

A list of tiny todos.

Never work on more than one todo at a time.

If multiple tasks must be carried out to finish a todo, track them as a nested ordered list of the todo list item.

When a todo is done, delete it.

## Todos

1. Cmd+Enter should skip to next code line if current line is empty or comment.
2. Reader mode: center + set max-width so it does not take up full width.
3. Combine Run buttons into a single button with a dropdown.
    1. Default: "Run all".
    2. Drop down options: Run all, Run current.
4. Use icons for Run, Autorun, Reader.
5. Use css grid for output so we can align badges and content.
