# Tiny todos

A list of tiny todos.

Never work on more than one todo at a time.

If multiple tasks must be carried out to finish a todo, track them as a nested ordered list of the todo list item.

When a todo is done, delete it.

## Todos

1. Reader mode: center + set max-width so it does not take up full width.
2. Combine Run buttons into a single button with a dropdown.
    1. Default: "Run all".
    2. Drop down options: Run all, Run current.
3. Use icons for Run, Autorun, Reader.
4. Use css grid for output so we can align badges and content.
5. Render top-level f-strings as Markdown.
6. Text-wrap output, even when there's no whitespace.
7. `"""` should trigger `"""\n[CURSOR]\n"""`
