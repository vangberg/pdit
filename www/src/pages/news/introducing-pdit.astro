  <p>
    We're excited to introduce <strong>pdit</strong>, an interactive Python editor
    that displays execution results inline, right next to your code.
  </p>

  <h2>Why pdit?</h2>

  <p>
    Jupyter notebooks are great for exploration, but they can feel heavy for
    quick scripts. Traditional REPLs are fast but don't preserve your work.
    pdit sits in between: you write regular Python files, but see results inline
    like a notebook.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Inline results</strong> - Output appears right next to the code
      that produced it
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DataFrames</strong> - Pandas DataFrames render as clean tables
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plots</strong> - Matplotlib figures appear inline automatically
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>File watching</strong> - Edit in your favorite editor and see
      updates in real-time
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Export</strong> - Share your work as standalone HTML files
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>Install pdit with pip:</p>

  <pre><code>pip install pdit</code></pre>

  <p>Then run it on any Python file:</p>

  <pre><code>pdit script.py</code></pre>

  <p>
    Check out the <a href="/manual">manual</a> for more details on installation
    and usage.
  </p>

  <h2>What's Next</h2>

  <p>
    This is just the beginning. We're working on more features including better
    error handling, performance improvements, and more output types. Stay tuned!
