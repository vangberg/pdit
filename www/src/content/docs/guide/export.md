## HTML Export

Export your script with its results to a standalone HTML file:

```bash
pdit export script.py -o output.html
```

The exported file contains:
- Your source code with syntax highlighting
- All execution results
- DataFrames rendered as tables
- Plots as embedded images

## Sharing

The exported HTML is completely self-contained. Share it via email, upload to a web server, or include in documentation.

## Use Cases

- **Reports** - Share analysis results with colleagues
- **Documentation** - Include code examples with output
- **Archiving** - Save a snapshot of your work
