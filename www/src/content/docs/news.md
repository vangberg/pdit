## Introducing pdit

*January 2024*

We're excited to introduce **pdit**, an interactive Python editor that displays execution results inline.

### Why pdit?

Jupyter notebooks are great for exploration, but they can feel heavy for quick scripts. Traditional REPLs are fast but don't preserve your work. pdit sits in between: you write regular Python files, but see results inline like a notebook.

### Key Features

- **Inline results** - Output appears right next to the code that produced it
- **DataFrames** - Pandas DataFrames render as clean tables
- **Plots** - Matplotlib figures appear inline automatically
- **File watching** - Edit in your favorite editor and see updates in real-time
- **Export** - Share your work as standalone HTML files

### Getting Started

Install with pip and run on any Python file:

```bash
pip install pdit
pdit script.py
```

Check out the [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started/) guide for more details.
