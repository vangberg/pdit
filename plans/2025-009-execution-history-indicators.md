# Execution History Visual Indicators

## Overview

The editor displays visual indicators showing which lines of code have been executed during your session. This helps you track the flow of your interactive coding session and understand which parts of your code have been run.

## Visual Feedback

Lines in the editor display colored left borders based on their execution state:

- **Dark blue left border** - Lines that were most recently executed
- **Light blue left border** - Lines that were previously executed
- **No border** - Lines that haven't been executed

## Use Cases

- Track which code has been run during an exploratory session
- Quickly identify the most recent execution
- Understand the execution flow when debugging
- See at a glance which parts of your code are active vs inactive
